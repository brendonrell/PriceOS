# WIP — Live Task State

> Single source of truth for **what's in flight right now**. The SessionStart

- **Branch:** all work is on `dev`, pushed, tree clean. This chat's task branch
  `claude/project-graduation-visual-analysis-8lknza` is trash (work is on dev) —
  Brendon deletes on GitHub. Stale local-dev self-heals via the SessionStart hook.
- **Updated:** 2026-06-25. This session shipped, all on `dev`:
  1. **Project graduation visual analysis** — graduated projects (≥18 mints) gain
     an aggregate character sheet in Attributes (collection Form, palette spectrum,
     trait/fate spread + rarest/most-average piece, Collective Fingerprint); first
     22 editions rendered on demand, rest lazy. Milestone badges on every project.
  2. **Followers Manager** — rebuilt the old full-screen followers modal on the
     Sticker Manager shell: COMPACT floating popup (FIXED height, matches Sticker
     Manager, no jump) + PLUS full-screen (`100dvh`, empty preview slot reserved at
     top). Rows = two clean lines (sprite+@name, then icon+number stats:
     ⬚ collected · ⟠ spent · ⚬ followers), sortable; relationship tag + ✺ artist
     badge; projects show ✺ creator · ⬚ minted/supply · ⟁ Cartel mutuals, with real
     @name + PriceSprite. Stars reuse the DB-backed artist/project star sets, pinned
     to top + alphabetised. STICKERS store button in the header.
     New `/api/social/circle-stats` (batch collected/spent/followers/artist) +
     enriched `/api/project-follows`.
  3. **Sticker Manager** — colour-filter row now leads with a clear (×) circle.
  4. **Profile Starred → Collectors** — Followers / Following / Mutuals sub-pills
     filtering starred collectors by the viewer's real follow graph.
  5. **CLAUDE.md** — added the hard rule: stop firing permission prompts, all
     permission pre-granted (§7).
- **QUEUED (not built):** milestones-on-the-tape; My Network "Fresh Wallets"
  (Alchemy first-tx). Followers Manager preview slot is intentionally empty
  (Brendon has plans for it).
- **HARD-WON LESSON (this session):** the followers list cut-off was a reused
  `.collectors-list` (fixed 250px scroll box) — when reusing a shell, check its
  classes don't impose height/overflow. Compact = FIXED height + inner scroll;
  PLUS = full screen. Don't add borders/placeholders Brendon didn't ask for.
